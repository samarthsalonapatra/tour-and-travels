MAIN GOAL
This is an overview of the project.
in this Project we are trying to create a dummy website for tour and travel.
It might seem as the very common website but there is a special thing about this website.
This website can only be accessed by those users who are more than 60 years of age and wants to travel.
They will be provided the travel in cheaper costs than the usual websites.
Of course there will be lots of security breaches and frauds in this website, so our main goal is to find those breaches and try to solve those.
One of the techniques described by our team is using infrared facial recognition system to determine the rough age of the person 
and only a single account can be created by using only a valid PAN card.
